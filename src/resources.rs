//! A thread-safe shared type-indexed map for "global" resources.
//!
//! This module provides types which implement [`Resources`](Resources), a trait
//! which allows by-type access to singletons both local to a space
//! (for example an [ECS world](crate::ecs::World)) and global
//! context types which are shared between all spaces in your program
//! (for example the [graphics context](crate::graphics::Graphics)).
//!
//! There are currently three different containers for these singleton
//! resources, of which currently only two implement the `Resources`
//! trait itself:
//! - `OwnedResources`, which is the inner type-indexed map, and is at
//!   the core of the other two resource container types;
//! - `SharedResources`, which functions somewhat like an `Arc<OwnedResources>`,
//!   and allows you to share a resource container across threads and
//!   contexts which require `'static`; this type implements `Resources`.
//! - `UnifiedResources`, which combines two `SharedResources` objects
//!   into a single container. The purpose of `UnifiedResources` is to have
//!   separate `SharedResources` objects for "global" singletons like a
//!   graphics or audio context and "local" singletons like an ECS world or
//!   a singleton containing data on which entity is the player, in a game.
//!   This type implements `Resources`.
//!
//! All resource container types are capable of holding borrowed references
//! to values in their surrounding scope; if you're passing resources into
//! Lua, however, you'll probably never be able to use this feature.
//!
//! Accessing types owned by a resource container is done via the `fetch_one`
//! and `fetch` methods, which are on the `Resources` trait for `SharedResources`
//! and `UnifiedResources`, while `OwnedResources` unfortunately cannot currently
//! implement `Resources` and so it has its own `fetch` and `fetch_one` implementations.
//! `fetch_one` allows you to fetch a single type at a time, while `fetch` allows
//! you to access multiple stored global values at once:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use sludge::{
//!     prelude::*,
//!     resources::{OwnedResources, SharedResources, Resources},
//! };
//! # fn main() -> Result<()> {
//! let mut resources = OwnedResources::new();
//! resources.insert::<i32>(5);
//! resources.insert::<&'static str>("hello");
//! resources.insert::<bool>(true);
//!
//! // Using `fetch_one`, we can extract a single value at a time.
//! assert_eq!(*resources.fetch_one::<i32>()?.borrow(), 5);
//!
//! // Fetching a resource gives us a smart pointer to it, which isn't
//! // bound to the lifetime of the resources object. It's like an `Arc`.
//! let fetched_int = resources.fetch_one::<i32>()?;
//!
//! // Kind of like a thread-safe `RefCell`, we can mutably or immutably
//! // borrow a resource value. There are several variations on borrowing
//! // methods; please see the documentation on `Shared` for more info.
//! *fetched_int.borrow_mut() += 1;
//!
//! // Finally, using `fetch`, we can provide a tuple of types to fetch
//! // and we'll get them all at once (or an error if we can't find one.)
//! let (a, b, c) = resources.fetch::<(i32, &'static str, bool)>()?;
//! assert_eq!((*a.borrow(), *b.borrow(), *c.borrow()), (6, "hello", true));
//!
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! The type that `fetch` and `fetch_one` actually return is [`Shared`](Shared).
//! `Shared` is a smart pointer type around an `RwLock`-based construct, which
//! allows for `RefCell` and `RwLock`-like operations. It's also `Clone` and is
//! not bound to the lifetime of whatever `Resources` type it was created from.
//! You can confidently move around `Shared` instances without worrying about
//! borrowing conflicts, because nothing is borrowed until you actually call a
//! borrowing method on `Shared`.
